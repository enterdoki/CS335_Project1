The files AvlTree.h, AvlTree.cpp, and  dsexceptions.h can be used 
in your programs. Just attribute the code to Mark Allen  Weiss in your 
program.


Starting the project firstly by working on implementation of tree then moved onto tree_species. 
For tree_species, I was not able to correctly implement get_matching_species to not exclude the negative examples:

Negative Examples:
range does not match Osage-orange
Japanese horn does not match Japanese hornbeam
chest does not match chestnut
locust does not match honeylocust

I've tried using a split on space function to get around this but due to time constraints and the difficulty of this project, I had to move onto tree_collection.
It is my fault that I started a bit too late and it's quite unfortunate that to be surprise, tree_collection would be quite if not more difficult to implement than 
tree_species. Getting a bunch of template issues. Cannot quite grasp multiple inheritance, friend classes, and had to set class AvlNode to public to even remotely properly code.
Then there's <iostream.h>, causing a bunch of compiling errors locally. Project's not complete but I gave it my best and hope it turns out ok.
